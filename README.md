Hetrix Exercise for TII 
==============

<img src="v2/hextris/images/twitter-opengraph.png" width="100px"><br>

Bellow are instructions of prerequisites for the project. I have made 2 versions of the exercise as you can see of the files of the project. Details of the 2 versions and differences will be discussed bellow.

### Prerequisites

For both project we are going to need and install the following tools:

* [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads) can easily be installed from the link, in order to deploy and run our infrastructure.
* [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/) is the tool that will set up our local Kubernetes cluster on whichever OS we have (my main PC OS is Windows 10).
* [Kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-windows/) will be needed to access our local cluster with ease.
* [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) Has been used on both projects in order to deploy and run our app on our cluster.

After downloading the tools and running the installation instructions we are ready to move to the next step of deploying and running our infrastructure and app.
